# STA303-Portfolio
This portfolio was made for the University of Toronto STA302 (Methods of Data Analysis II) class. Within this portfolio shows examples of both my soft and technical statistical skills.

For soft skills, here you can see some data visualization, writing excerpts and explanations of statistical concepts. There are a multitude of graphs generated with ggplot as well as explanations of confidence intervals and p-values. There is also even an exploration of the concept of p-values and what they mean through the use of multiple simulated values taken from different distributions. There is also a writing sample which is a piece written with information taken from an article dealing with misconceptions of data analysis.

For technical skills, there are a variety of skills shown here. From understanding the more theoretical concepts around things such as confidence and p-values to model creation and interpretation. Within this portfolio, I attempt to fit a linear mixed model to data taken from a simulated strawberry patch. Here, I designate fixed and random effects as well as interaction terms. With the model and the data, I even derive the variance of the model as well as variance of each term.

Looking through this portfolio I hope you get a good understanding of my capabilities as well as my understanding of statistical concepts
